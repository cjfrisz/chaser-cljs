* rewrite player object coordinates code in terms of a "position" 
  interface; possibly rewrite player as record with PPosition protocol
  - done in terms of existing hashmap-based implementation
* implement continuous movement rather than current space-by-space style
* add randomized connections between rooms instead of defaulting to all
  connected rooms
* create a camera to limit the space the player can see around their
  avatar
* make a container environment for the logical game object environment
  (i.e. the stuff in chanser-cljs.game-env), the game-renderer, and the
  event queue (currently improperly named & implemented as key-stream)
* update chaser-cljs.server to also handle serving the repl index.html
